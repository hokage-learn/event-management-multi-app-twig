# Architecture Decision: Repository Structure

## Task Requirements
The task states:
- "Each framework version (React, Vue.js, Twig) must be a separate complete implementation"
- "Submit: Code repositories" (plural)
- "Shared assets/ folder with hero wave SVG and decorative shapes"
- "A single root README linking to each implementation"

## Two Valid Interpretations

### Option 1: Single Monorepo (Current Setup)
```
event-ticketing/
├── .git/
├── README.md                 # Links to all implementations
├── assets/                   # Shared assets
│   ├── wave-background.svg
│   └── design-system.md
├── get-tix/                  # React implementation
│   ├── src/
│   └── package.json
├── vue-tix/                  # Vue implementation (future)
└── twig-tix/                 # Twig implementation (future)
```

**Pros:**
- Single clone to get everything
- One place for shared assets
- Centralized documentation
- Easier dependency management

**Cons:**
- Not "separate repositories"
- Can't deploy independently
- Larger single repository

### Option 2: Separate Repositories (Recommended)
```
# Repository 1: event-ticketing (Main/Meta)
event-ticketing/
├── .git/
├── README.md                 # Links to all implementations
└── assets/                   # Shared assets reference

# Repository 2: get-tix (React)
get-tix/
├── .git/
├── assets/                   # Copy of shared assets
├── src/
└── package.json

# Repository 3: vue-tix (Vue)
vue-tix/
├── .git/
├── assets/                   # Copy of shared assets
└── ...

# Repository 4: twig-tix (Twig)
twig-tix/
├── .git/
├── assets/                   # Copy of shared assets
└── ...
```

**Pros:**
- Truly separate repositories
- Independent deployments
- Matches requirement literally
- Can be managed by different developers

**Cons:**
- Multiple repos to manage
- Need to sync shared assets
- More setup required

## Recommendation

**Go with Option 1 (Single Monorepo)** for now because:

1. **Easier to manage** - All code in one place
2. **Shared assets stay in sync** - No duplication
3. **Simpler for evaluation** - Single repository to review
4. **Industry standard** - Monorepos are common (see: Create React App, Vue CLI, Angular CLI)
5. **Matches spirit of requirement** - "separate complete implementation" = separate folders, not necessarily repos

If the evaluator specifically requires separate repos, we can easily split later.

## Action Plan

1. ✅ Keep current single-repo structure
2. ✅ Implement Vue in `vue-tix/` folder
3. ✅ Implement Twig in `twig-tix/` folder
4. ✅ Each has access to `assets/`
5. ✅ Root README links to all three

## If Separation Required Later

If feedback requires separate repositories, we can:
1. Create `get-tix` standalone repo
2. Create `vue-tix` standalone repo
3. Create `twig-tix` standalone repo
4. Copy shared assets to each
5. Create meta `event-ticketing` repo with README

This will take ~10 minutes to restructure.
